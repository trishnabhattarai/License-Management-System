A license management system is a digital tool that manages tasks like the license renewal process and verification of driving licenses. As we know, the process of getting a 
license from the government took a long period of time, but we can minimize the time by helping people shift their process in a digital way. We can’t shift the training process 
in a digital way because it won’t be practical. With the help of this system, we can notify or give updates to the drivers about the new traffic rules. If we become successful in 
this project in real life, then we can see the traffic violation done by the driver, according to which we can automatically debit the traffic fine from the user's bank account in a month. 
According to traffic violations, we can also identify the knowledge level of drivers in traffic rules. Simply put, we can also use a rating system that will rate the user automatically by 
the machine according to the level of traffic violation. The main step of this license management system is getting a license from the government and renewing it in under 5 years. 
While getting a license from the government, drivers need to meet criteria like age. 

Basically, the renewal process is done to update the government on how many drivers are used and which category of vehicles. The renewal process includes many steps, like collecting 
different documents, i.e., the original driving license, citizenship, medical document, etc., charging a renewal fee according to the category, and filling out the renewal form. 

This system was designed to minimize the contribution of the government, as the government can handle this task with the help of machines but is not totally contributing. 
This system also focuses on minimizing the rate of traffic violations by updating users about updated traffic rules, and we were also planning to include one function, i.e., 
the system can automatically detect the license number of the user who has committed traffic violations and can automatically debit the traffic fine from the user's bank account. 
As it would be more complex for us and also need to have more research on the required topic, we are planning to implement it in the future. Our system also encourages users to shift 
from low-level to high-level vehicles. According to the number of traffic violations done by the driver, our system will automatically rate the drivers. This project follows a structure 
approach where each member is assigned specific roles and responsibilities of the assignment.
